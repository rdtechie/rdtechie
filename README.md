### I work as a Senior Customer Engineer at Microsoft.

#### What am I up to?

- 🔭 I specialize in automating Azure. 😁
- 🌱 I’ve also been learning about coding languages like Python, Go & .NET 📓
- 🤔 I’m also working with technologies like Kubernetes and Linux. 🐢✅

#### Bio

👀 All my work is open source 👀

Sometimes people give me a mic and I talk about 💻. I'm thinking about doing some live-coding perhaps on 👨‍💻 📺 projects of all kinds.
I also like ☕️ with the word "mouthfeel" on the packaging.

- 🙂 My preferred pronouns are: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm originally from the province of Drenthe in the Netherlands, but don't hold that against me 😉
